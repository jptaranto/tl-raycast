# tl-raycast

Manage the command line time-logger via [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/).

### Setup

First build the extension: `npm i && npm run build`.

Then add the extension to Raycast using the "Import extension" command.

You'll need to configure the extension with the path to php and the path to tl.

### Development

Once imported to Raycast you can develop the extension just by running `npm run dev`.

Raycast dev supports hot reloading on save.

Keep things tidy with `npm run format`.
